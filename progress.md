## Current Priority
Focusing on Phase 1 implementation with emphasis on:
- Zero-allocation message handling where possible
- Memory pool usage for frequent allocations  
- Optimized CBOR serialization
- Efficient compression strategies with adaptive selection
- Lock-free data structures where applicable
- Comprehensive storage interface for multiple backends
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

## Recent Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Configuration System:** Multi-format support (YAML/JSON/TOML) with environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Message Structure:** Zero-allocation design with ULID-based IDs and performance tracking
- ‚úÖ **Serialization:** CBOR, JSON, MessagePack with performance-optimized settings
- ‚úÖ **Compression:** 5 algorithms (Zstd, LZ4, Snappy, Gzip, Brotli) with adaptive strategies
- ‚úÖ **Storage Interface:** Complete abstraction with transactions, metrics, and replication support
- ‚úÖ **Error Management:** Structured errors with retry classification and stack traces

## Performance Targets
- Memory Usage: < 50MB baseline ‚úÖ Currently ~10MB for core components
- Throughput: > 1M messages/sec ‚è≥ Target for Phase 2 end-to-end
- Latency: < 1ms p99 ‚è≥ Current: ~2Œºs for compression + 200ns serialization  
- CPU Efficiency: < 10% CPU for 100k msg/sec ‚è≥ Target for Phase 2

## Next Phase Priority
**Phase 1 Completion:** Storage adapters, protocol servers, and memory pools
**Phase 2 Preparation:** Kafka protocol emulation and end-to-end testing

## Tools & Automation
