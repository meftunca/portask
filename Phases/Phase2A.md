# Phase 2A: Network Layer & Storage Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2A builds upon the solid foundation of Phase 1 to implement production-ready network communication and persistent storage systems. This phase focuses on high-performance networking, multiple storage backends, and robust connection management.

## Implementation Goals

### Network Layer
- **High-performance TCP server** with optimized connection handling
- **HTTP/REST API** for management and monitoring  
- **WebSocket support** for real-time communication
- **Protocol multiplexing** for multiple connection types
- **Connection pooling** and lifecycle management
- **Back-pressure handling** and flow control

### Storage Layer
- **Abstract storage interface** supporting multiple backends
- **Dragonfly/Redis adapter** with optimized data structures
- **In-memory storage** for high-speed scenarios
- **Connection pooling** with auto-recovery
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for resilience
- **Metrics integration** for monitoring

## Performance Targets

### Network Performance
- **Latency:** <1ms p99 for local network
- **Throughput:** >1M connections/sec establishment
- **Concurrent Connections:** >100K simultaneous
- **Memory per Connection:** <1KB overhead

### Storage Performance  
- **Read Latency:** <100μs p99 from Dragonfly
- **Write Latency:** <200μs p99 to Dragonfly
- **Throughput:** >1M ops/sec to storage
- **Connection Pool:** 100-1000 connections per backend

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Storage Interface & Adapters
- Abstract storage interface design
- Dragonfly/Redis adapter implementation
- Memory adapter for caching
- Connection pool management
- Retry and circuit breaker logic

### 2. Network Protocol Server
- TCP server with connection multiplexing
- Protocol parser and message framing
- Connection lifecycle management
- Load balancing and routing

### 3. HTTP/REST API Layer
- Management endpoints
- Metrics and monitoring APIs
- Health check endpoints
- Configuration endpoints

### 4. WebSocket Real-time Layer
- WebSocket server implementation
- Real-time message streaming
- Connection state management
- Broadcasting capabilities

## Getting Started
Let's begin with the Storage Interface and Dragonfly adapter implementation.
